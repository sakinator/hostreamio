## 🔗 Stream & Link Tiers Explained

Hostreamio unifies direct file hosters, adaptive HLS web streams, and cloud debrid caching into a clear, prioritized stream hierarchy in Nuvio and Stremio:

└───────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 1. ⚡ `TorBox [Cached]`
* **What it means:** The file hoster link has already been downloaded and cached on TorBox's high-speed cloud servers.
* **Experience:** Instant playback (0ms start delay) streaming directly from TorBox's global and Indian CDN edge nodes with full byte-range seeking (`HTTP 206`).
* **Audio & Badges:** Features complete audio, codec, and resolution badges (e.g. `[4K] [Remux] [HDR] [Hindi]`).

### 2. 🌐 `TorBox [Start Caching]` / `[Cachable]`
* **What it means:** The link is on a hoster supported by TorBox's WebDL engine (HubCloud, PixelDrain, DriveSeed, GDrive, 1fichier, Rapidgator, etc.), but nobody has cached it yet.
* **Experience:** Selecting this link immediately submits the URL to your TorBox account's WebDL downloader in 1 click and begins streaming as soon as caching completes.

### 3. 🌐 `Direct Play [Hoster / Provider]`
* **What it means:** The original hoster download URL or direct cloud stream.
* **Experience:** Completely independent of debrid. Plays directly using Hostreamio's embedded smart proxy (`/proxy`) to inject required browser headers (`Referer`, `Origin`, `User-Agent`) so that Nuvio's internal MPV player plays without CORS or 403 blocks.

### 4. ⚡ `Adaptive HLS (.m3u8)`
* **What it means:** Adaptive bitrate web streams from providers like VidLink, LookMovie, Movy, Vimeo, and Dailymotion.
* **Experience:** Smooth playback that automatically scales resolution based on your internet connection speed.

### 💡 The Dual-Rail Implementation Philosophy: Why Hostreamio Is Built This Way

Most conventional Stremio / Nuvio debrid addons enforce a rigid all-or-nothing model: if a file isn't pre-cached on debrid, you are blocked from playback, and if the debrid API experiences downtime or maintenance, the entire addon goes dark.

Hostreamio was architected around a resilient, **Dual-Rail Zero Single-Point-of-Failure (SPOF)** philosophy:

    end
```

1. **Watch Immediately on Direct Play While TorBox Caches (Zero Idle Wait Time):**
   * When discovering a fresh, rare, or newly scraped 4K/1080p release on HubCloud, DriveSeed, or PixelDrain that isn't yet cached in TorBox's cloud (`[Cachable]`), you don't have to stare at a caching progress bar.
   * You can dispatch the 1-click cloud caching job to TorBox so it is downloaded and accelerated in the cloud, and **simultaneously click `🌐 Direct Play` to start watching the movie right now** without waiting a single second for the cloud download to complete.

2. **Zero P2P Guarantee & Cloud Debrid Bridge (Strictly Default OFF):**
   * Unlike conventional addons that force you into BitTorrent swarms, Hostreamio never exposes your IP to peers.
   * If you opt-in to the Cached Torrents toggle, only releases that are **100% pre-cached on TorBox cloud CDN** are ever served. Uncached torrents are completely discarded at the engine boundary — zero seeding, zero waiting, pure cloud line-speed.

3. **Live Caching Queue & In-Video Player Notice:**
   * Track real-time download progress, transfer speeds, ETA, and size in the dedicated **⚡ Caching Queue** tab.
   * If an in-progress link is opened directly in Nuvio, Stremio, or VLC, Hostreamio serves an animated in-video notice (`/video/caching.mp4`) instead of failing with an HTTP error.

4. **Bulletproof Resilience When TorBox Is Down:**
   * Cloud debrid services can undergo API maintenance, rate-limiting, edge-node routing hiccups, or billing expirations.
   * If TorBox is temporarily offline or unreachable, Hostreamio **never goes dark**. Every single file hoster stream always exposes a parallel `🌐 Direct Play` counterpart routed through Hostreamio's built-in header-injection proxy (`/proxy`). Your streaming theater remains 100% functional 24/7.

5. **No Debrid Lock-In (Subscription Freedom):**
   * A TorBox account is treated as an optional performance enhancement, never a mandatory requirement. Users without a debrid subscription enjoy full, unrestricted access to all 63 direct non-torrent HTTP scrapers, regional Indian OTT feeds, and Asian anime libraries out of the box.

### Scenario B: Running Standalone on Android TV / Fire TV / Phone (via `hostreamio.apk`)
1. **Install the APK:**
   - Sideload [`hostreamio.apk`](https://github.com/sakinator/hostreamio/releases/latest/download/hostreamio.apk) onto your Android TV or phone (via *Send Files to TV*, *Downloader*, or *ADB*).
   - Open **Hostreamio**. The engine starts automatically in the background on port `7002` with wake-lock support.
   - *(Optional)* Enter your TorBox API key and click **Save & Validate**.
2. **Install into Nuvio (on the Same Device):**
   - Switch to **Nuvio** on your TV or phone.
   - Go to: **Settings (⚙️)** ➔ **General** ➔ **Content & Discovery** ➔ **Addons** ➔ Click **`+`**.
   - Enter the localhost address:
     ```text
     http://127.0.0.1:7002/manifest.json
     ```
     *(Or click the `1-Click Install (Stremio / Nuvio)` button directly inside the Hostreamio Android app).*
   - Click **Install**.
3. **Enable Badges in Nuvio:**
   - In Nuvio: **Settings (⚙️)** ➔ **General** ➔ **Layout** ➔ **Streams** ➔ **Fusion Badge URLs**.
   - Paste: `http://127.0.0.1:7002/badges.json` and save.

---

### Scenario C: Running Nuvio / Stremio on the Same Windows PC
1. **Launch Hostreamio:** Double-click `hostreamio.exe`.
2. **1-Click Install:**
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:7002/configure`.
   - Click **`🚀 1-Click Install to Stremio / Nuvio`** (or open `stremio://127.0.0.1:7002/manifest.json`).
   - Or in Nuvio Desktop: **Settings (⚙️)** ➔ **General** ➔ **Content & Discovery** ➔ **Addons** ➔ **`+`** ➔ `http://localhost:7002/manifest.json`.
3. **Badges:** Set Fusion Badges URL in Nuvio (**Settings ➔ General ➔ Layout ➔ Streams**) to `http://localhost:7002/badges.json`.

---

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Verification
* **Test Manifest in Browser:** Open `http://localhost:7002/manifest.json` (or `http://<LAN_IP>:7002/manifest.json`). It should return valid JSON with `"id": "org.sakinator.hostreamio"`.
* **Windows Firewall Rule (if TV cannot connect):** Run in PowerShell as Administrator:
  ```powershell
  New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Hostreamio Addon Server" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 7002 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
  ```
* **Recommended Player in Nuvio:** For the best buffering and seeking experience with TorBox and HLS streams, go to Nuvio **Settings** ➔ **Player** and ensure **ExoPlayer** (default) or **MPV** is selected.

---

## 🔑 TorBox & Metadata Configuration

All external API integrations are 100% optional:
1. Open the Web Dashboard at `http://localhost:7002/configure` (or the Android APK settings screen).
2. Enter any optional keys (TorBox, OMDb, Fanart, TheTVDB, TMDB).
3. Click **Save & Validate**.
4. The dashboard will verify your credentials in real time against upstream APIs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Strict Privacy Guarantee:** None of your API keys are ever shared, committed to Git, or uploaded to third parties. They are stored exclusively in your local `data/config.json`.

---

## 🛡️ Optional: Cloudflare Captcha Bypass (FlareSolverr Setup)

Hostreamio features a **Prowlarr-style Captcha & Cloudflare Resolver** ([`ProxyResolverService`](file:///D:/hostreamio/lib/proxy_resolver.dart)). While Hostreamio bypasses most standard edge blocks automatically using origin-fresh anti-cache headers, indexers like *1TamilMV*, *Vegamovies*, *Bollyflix*, or *Nyaa* occasionally activate strict Cloudflare Turnstile or IUAM challenges ("Just a moment...").

You can connect Hostreamio to **FlareSolverr** to solve these challenges automatically:

### 1. Run FlareSolverr

* **Option A: Via Docker (Recommended):**
  ```bash
  docker run -d \
    --name=flaresolverr \
    -p 8191:8191 \
    -e LOG_LEVEL=info \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    ghcr.io/flaresolverr/flaresolverr:latest
  ```

* **Option B: Windows Standalone (No Docker Needed):**
  1. Download the latest `flaresolverr_windows_x64.zip` from [FlareSolverr GitHub Releases](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr/releases).
  2. Extract and run `flaresolverr.exe`. It listens locally on `http://localhost:8191`.

### 2. Configure in Hostreamio

1. Open the Web Dashboard at `http://localhost:7002/configure` (or open the Android app).
2. Go to the **🖥️ Server & Addon** tab and scroll to **🛡️ Cloudflare & Anti-Bot Captcha Resolver**.
3. Set the Resolver URL:
   ```text
   http://localhost:8191/v1
   ```
   *(Or `http://<YOUR_NAS_OR_SERVER_IP>:8191/v1` if running on another machine).*
4. Click **Save Settings**.

### 3. How It Operates

* **Zero-Wait In-Memory Cookie Store:** When FlareSolverr solves a challenge, Hostreamio saves the clearance cookie (`cf_clearance`) in memory for 1 hour. All subsequent requests to that domain complete at normal, instant line speeds with zero delay.
* **Purely Optional:** If you do not configure FlareSolverr, Hostreamio simply scrapes directly without external dependencies. Zero bloat is bundled into the Hostreamio binary.

### ⚡ Community Torrent Scrapers (7 Providers • Gated by TorBox Cached Torrents Toggle • Default OFF • 0 P2P)

> [!NOTE]
> **Strict 0 P2P Guarantee:** These providers are only queried when explicitly enabled by the user in settings (`enableTorboxCachedTorrents = true`). When enabled, torrent hashes are checked in batch against TorBox debrid — **only 100% pre-cached files** are served via TorBox's global high-speed HTTPS CDN (`$localBaseUrl/torbox/play`). Uncached torrents are dropped immediately (zero seeding, zero waiting, zero swarm connections).

## 🔄 Automated Update Pipeline & Reliable Pull Sources (No-AI Pulls)

Hostreamio operates an autonomous, platform-neutral update pipeline designed to keep providers, scrapers, and binaries up to date **without requiring manual AI intervention**.

### Reliable Upstream Pull Sources:
1. **Authoritative Git Repository (`origin/main`):**
   - **Source:** `https://github.com/sakinator/hostreamio.git`
   - **Pull Mechanism:** `git pull --rebase --autostash origin main`
   - **Purpose:** Automatically pulls newly added scrapers, bug fixes, badge rules, and server enhancements without merge conflicts.
2. **GitHub Releases API (Pre-Compiled Binaries & APK):**
   - **Source:** `https://api.github.com/repos/sakinator/hostreamio/releases/latest`
   - **Purpose:** Provides direct release downloads for `hostreamio-windows-x64.zip` and `hostreamio.apk` for standalone installations without Git.
3. **Real-Time Dynamic Domain Mapping (`urls.json`):**
   - **Source:** [`SaurabhKaperwan/Utils/urls.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SaurabhKaperwan/Utils/refs/heads/main/urls.json)
   - **Purpose:** Tracks real-time active domain rotations for rotating Indian & Asian streaming providers (*VegaMovies, HDHub4u, MoviesDrive, UHDMovies, Bollyflix, HubCloud, VCloud*). Prevents scrapers from breaking when mirror domains rotate.
4. **Upstream PlayTorrio Providers:**
   - **Source:** `https://github.com/ayman708-UX/PlayTorrioV3.git`
   - **Pull Mechanism:** Auto-stashed submodule check inside `upstream/PlayTorrioV3`.

### 1-Click Update Command:
```powershell
dart run tool/update.dart
```
This single command automatically pulls updates, checks upstream providers, regenerates the registry across both the server and Android app, compiles the standalone binary, embeds the 8% rounded brand icon via `rcedit`, and triggers an instant zero-downtime hot-reload on the running addon server.

## ✨ Vibe Coded Philosophy & Manifesto

> *"Code at the speed of thought. Guided by vibes, verified by automated test suites."*

This entire codebase — spanning 56 stream scrapers, dynamic HLS proxying, TorBox cloud debrid caching, cross-platform Android TV / mobile interfaces, and live update pipelines — is **100% Vibe Coded**.

### What does "Vibe Coded" mean here?
- **AI-Native Architecture**: Conceived, architected, debugged, and refined through symbiotic interaction between human vision and autonomous AI coding agents (DeepMind Antigravity / Gemini / Claude).
- **Rapid Self-Healing**: Automated QA loops, subagent audits, real-time JavaScript validation (`node -c`), and endpoint stress-testing catch edge cases before they ship.
- **Vibe Velocity**: Shipped iteratively at extreme velocity without bureaucratic technical debt — continuously evolving as streaming protocols, hosters, and community conventions update.
- **As-Is Provision**: As with all vibe-coded software, it is offered purely as open-source research and experimental tooling. Enjoy the vibes responsibly!
